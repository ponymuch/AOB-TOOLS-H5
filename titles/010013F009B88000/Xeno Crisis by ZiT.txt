So, with your first code, (credit to @Traiver here for his explanation on page 18)
04100000 AC3B90C0 00000XXX - Indicates the Item Value. The 16E0 is a Stone Axe that's unbreakable. If you wanted to replace the item with say a Gold Nugget, it'd be 09C9. You can find the Item IDs here: https://pastebin.com/raw/B8N5KKsh *(If there's an updated link, let me know and I'll replace it.)
04100000 AC3B90C4 000000XX - Indicates the Item Amount. It's not as simple as entering in a number, but if you wanted to multiply it by say x30, you'd put 1D as the last two characters.

To change the Item Slot, I believe you're editing this portion of the code:
