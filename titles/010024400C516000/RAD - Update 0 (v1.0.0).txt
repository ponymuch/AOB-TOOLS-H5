    This will allow you to instantly get a mutation when you kill any monster, or do anything that gives you xp. It gets annoying after the 10th or so mutation... so turn it off then.. with the note below.

    I suggest you turn this on/off in town, or when you're not fighting anything, as it rewrites a function and I am not to sure how the game/engine reacts to code being rewritten during the function.
